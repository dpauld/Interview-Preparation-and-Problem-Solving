## My Preparation Plan
Need to focus on learning the Data Structures & Algorithms below.
###Data Structures
1. Dynamic Array
2. Linked List
* Stack & Queue
* Hash Tables
* Binary Search Tree
Binary Heaps & Priority Queue
Graphs
Trie

### Algorithms
1. Bit Manipulation & Numbers — difference btw Unsigned vs signed numbers
Stability in Sorting
Mergesort
Quicksort
Heapsort — Sort it in-place to get O(1) space
Binary Search
Selections — Kth Smallest Elements (Sort, QuickSelect, Mediums of Mediums) — Implement all three ways
Permutations
Subsets
BFS Graph
DFS Graph
Dijkstra’s Algorithm (just learn the idea — no need to implement)
Tree Traversals — BFS, DFS (in-order, pre-order, post-order): Implement Recursive and Iterative
External Sort — No implementation; Just know the concept.
NP-Complete (Video) — Just know the concept
Topological Sort
Detect cycle in an undirected graph
Detect a cycle in a directed graph
Count connected components in a graph
Find strongly connected components in a graph
