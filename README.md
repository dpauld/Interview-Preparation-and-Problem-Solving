## My Preparation Plan
Need to focus on learning the Data Structures & Algorithms below. Sources used to make the plan [Mir Alis Medium Post](https://medium.com/@alimirio/before-you-start-solving-problems-on-leetcode-prep-work-9d65fc964c6f "Read this before you start solving problems on Leetcode (Prep Work)
") , 

###Data Structures
1. Dynamic Array
2. Linked List
3. Stack & Queue
4. Hash Tables
5. Binary Search Tree
6. Binary Heaps & Priority Queue
7. Graphs
8. Tree or Trie

### Algorithms
1. Bit Manipulation & Numbers — difference btw Unsigned vs signed numbers
2. Stability in Sorting
3. Mergesort
4. Quicksort
5. Heapsort — Sort it in-place to get O(1) space
6. Binary Search
7. Selections — Kth Smallest Elements (Sort, QuickSelect, Mediums of Mediums) — Implement all three ways
8. Permutations
9. Subsets
10. BFS Graph
11. DFS Graph
12. Dijkstra’s Algorithm (just learn the idea — no need to implement)
13. Tree Traversals — BFS, DFS (in-order, pre-order, post-order): Implement Recursive and Iterative
14. External Sort — No implementation; Just know the concept.
15. NP-Complete (Video) — Just know the concept
16. Topological Sort
17. Detect cycle in an undirected graph
18. Detect a cycle in a directed graph
19. Count connected components in a graph
20. Find strongly connected components in a graph

###Implementing the Datastructure and Algorithm work
After being comfortable with the data structures & algorithms above, have to do the following exercise multiple times (at least 2–3 times) until these can be done with eyes closed.

1. Implement an ArrayList from scratch
2. Reverse a linked list
3. Implement a Stack & a Queue using Array
4. Implement a HashTable with simple Hashing functions
5. Implement a Graph using Adjacency List, and then write functions for BFS & DFS.
6. Write the binary search algorithm both recursively and iteratively
7. Write the merge sort algorithm
8. Write the quicksort algorithm
9. Print binary tree using DFS (in-order, preorder and post order — all three of them) and BFS.
10. Memorize time & space complexities for common algorithms. Here’s an [interesting website.](https://www.bigocheatsheet.com/ "bigocheatsheet"),
11. Implement a trie.
12. Learn these important bit manipulation tricks. [geeksforgeeks bit tricks for CP]( https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bit-tricks-competitive-programming/ "geeksforgeeks bit tricks"),
